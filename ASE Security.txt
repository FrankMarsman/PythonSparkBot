Alexander is our official DJ for tomorrowâ€™s class =)
followed by some cool whiteboard session and designs! tomorrow will be 3 thingsâ€¦ will be F will be U and will be Nâ€¦ FUN
canâ€™t wait to hear your groups telling me more about our competitors!!! iâ€™m very interested!!!
wellâ€¦ you have free time to do other CSAP related stuff, like infinite learning hehe
so we have nothing from 8:30 to 10:30?
correct
i believe youâ€™ll also have a real deal speaker that day, is that right?
thatâ€™s absolutely correct =) we start later in the morning and get back to class at the end of the afternoon
Hello Marcos, next Mondayâ€™s Outlook appointment for our class differs from all other dayâ€™s schedule (10:300-13:00). Is it correct?
please, organize yourselves into groups, choose a topic and follow the rules on the image =)
5 minutes per group, the way you preferâ€¦ ppt, whiteboard, oral talkâ€¦

AND REMEMBER base your discussion on Firewall and IPS (so, for instance, McAfee guys, do not focus on Endpoint protection (Anti-virus))

thanks =)

Marc will be our official DJ tomorrow
In preparation for tomorrowâ€™s class, I have to admit it is going to be AMAZING!!!! Demos and Whiteboards on the way!!! And coffeeâ€¦ a lot of coffeeâ€¦ eventually some red bull as well, if Frank allows for it!!!!
I need to make a confession!!!
I have my role-play tomorrow at 14-> so unfortunately I will not be able to join for the last part but I will watch the recording later
Ladies and gentlemen!!! Good evening!!! I hope everyone made it safe to your home =)

Due to the short notice change in tomorrowâ€™s scheduled, this is what tomorrow looks like for us:

8.30 - 9.45 -> Security Class
Out for the Event
10.15 - 12:30 -> Security Class

Then (IMPORTANT) we will be back for class at 13.45 - 15.15 (1.5h) to finish the content delivery @ St Stevenâ€™s Green Room!!

Hopefully that works for all of you!

Any main issue?

Corinne and Antoine thanks for joining virtually! I know it is not the same experience but hopefully youâ€™re able to absorb the knowledge as well =)
