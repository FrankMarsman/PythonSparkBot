Has anyone deployed their bot on Heroku?
CAKE TIME !
thanks
Ah, ok. I don‚Äôt know nothing about it, but for more advance features use: https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/ciscosparkapi
I‚Äôm using the botkit-ciscospark-samples on github
Framework like Flask?
All right. Thanks !
I‚Äôm using a framework, and I didn‚Äôt have to manage this part. I will try to find where is it taken from
Exactly, the roomID is included in the JSON from the web hook, for both cases: a 1:1 room or a group room
It is a attribute of the message you receive in the webhook
you use the roomid that the webhook sent to you to do the post in the right room
roomId    =  JSON['data']["roomId"]
i‚Äôm using the JS botkit
that‚Äôs what I want to get
The webhook sends you the room id that generated the message
or you just don‚Äôt send roomID ?
you leave roomID empty ?
so you POST something like this to Spark ?

spark_json = {
"roomId": ,
"text": sparkMessage
}
The room ID that the bot needs will be contained in the message it receives from spark
where it is added and mentioned
the spark bot talks to all the rooms
what will happen?
you can leave the roomid empty Antoine
probably not, if I remember correctly, you‚Äôre not using a bot
Is that what you need ?
python
I can do that in mython
Hello, (regarding programability project with Spark)
is someone able to get the roomID of the room where the bot is added, automatically ?

Right now, my roomID is hardcoded (I can find it using Postman, for sure).

I would like the bot to be able to get this roomID automatically, everytime it‚Äôs added to a room. So you can try the bot (the customer) without me having to hardcore a new roomID
Cool! Thanks
uhh nice!

Hi all!
Sen just reached out to us regarding the devnet training.
We will have 3 days of training, with 7 sessions. Of this 7 sessions we will have 4 facilitated sessions local in Amsterdam. And there are now 2 options on how this session will go.
Option 1: AMSI and AMSII all in Balboa (like with security). So we have all 4 sessions lead by a facilitator for everyone.
Option 2: AMSI in Bieschbos., AMSII in Balboa. Then each group has 2 sessions with a facilitator and 2 sessions over TP.
So please answer quickly to this bot.
Yes = Option 1, No = Option 2

Is anyone else going to Alt-J next week?
Yes, it is transparent to them . Packets will be decapsulated for them as if nothing happened 
Yes, they asked me to look for that as part of the feedback of my ARP and it is exactly what Christine said
I think we don‚Äôt have our load balancer - I think Anastasia mentioned that we use device pack for that
I think firewalls and load balancers also can be from other vendors: ‚ÄúHardware and Software Support

Cisco APIC communicates with the firewalls or load balancers to render the graph defined by the user. For Cisco ACI to be able to talk to firewalls or load balancers, it needs to speak to their APIs. The administrator needs to install plug-ins on Cisco APIC that enable this communication.

A plug-in is referred to as a device package, and the vendor of a firewall and load balancer must provide it so that Cisco APIC can communicate with it.‚Äù

https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/solutions/collateral/data-center-virtualization/application-centric-infrastructure/white-paper-c11-732493.html
Does anyone know if devices like firewalls and load balancer that we can use in service chains must be cisco or at least support opflex?
but it is internet, there would be wan, which is supposed to be better!
you can ping places around the world to get a sense
You can‚Äôt really say, there are some statistics here https://www.usenix.org/legacy/events/usenix02/full_papers/subramanian/subramanian_html/node21.html
Do you know how far?
so basically with 50ms the DC‚Äôs can be farther apart?
Yes, previously it was 10ms, now it is 50ms. The thing is that for 10ms (aprox 500 miles between DC) you only need a base license, but if you want to increase it to 50ms you need an advantage license 
üëãüèª
üëåthanks
so newest ones 50ms
‚ÄúIn previous ACI releases, this limit is 10 msec RTT instead.‚Äù"
As you said
Yeah but then you‚Äôre good.
they are both from 2017 which makes it even more confusing :P I also said 50ms in my ARP but was uncertain so promised to follow up on it :P
I believe 50 msec is also mentioned by the guy on the cisco live video, but I don‚Äôt promise
Afaik that said 50ms. At least thats what I went with in my ARP and Anastasia didn‚Äôt mention it was incorrect :D
Make sure you‚Äôre looking at the newest paper.
Im confused üòÇ
...
and then in the multipod whitepaper it says 10ms
Does anyone know what the maximum RTT for multipod is? I keep finding different information‚Ä¶. like this: ‚ÄúAdditionally, a maximum latency of 50 msec RTT can be supported between Pods starting from ACI software release 2.3. In previous ACI releases, this limit is 10 msec RTT instead.‚Äù

Victoria Christine Ololo, correction, both models belong to the ‚ÄúSDN‚Äù concept
source : https://www.sdxcentral.com/cisco/datacenter/definitions/cisco-openflow/
Declarative vs Imperative

Imperative describes a centralized SDN Controller that acts as the brains for the SDN environment; the controller receives requests from applications, via a northbound application program interface (API), and dictates downstream to the forwarding plane how the switches/routers need to be configured to answer the needs of the application. There is the potential for the centralized controller to become a bottleneck and a single point of failure in the network, which different implementations attempt to address.
Declarative describes a model where the SDN Controller declares what the application needs and sends that message to the network fabric for the switches and routers to determine how to meet the application‚Äôs requirements. A declarative control plane allows for more distributed intelligence; it sets a central policy, but gives power to network nodes to make more decisions about how to execute said policies.

source : https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/collateral/servers-unified-computing/ucs-6300-series-fabric-interconnects/datasheet-c78-736682.html
The second scheme is kind of good to show that (UCS-B on top, and UCS-B on the bottom). Or the FI is a linecard, or it‚Äôs a box
You buy UCS chassis and you need to buy a ‚Äúleaf switch‚Äù box.

From the doc, I think you have two choices.

You buy UCS blades, that will be inserted into a big chassis, like this one. This big chassis has 2 slots that can be used as Fabric Interconnect

but I guess its still different products from the customer point of view so you probably can‚Äôt buy a leaf as is and then later configure it to be a FI‚Ä¶ or?
according to this doc : ‚ÄúFabric Interconnect is a leaf with expanded policy and state interaction‚Äù
Here they seem to use top of the rack leaf switches so I guess it should work right? :D
Do you have the same performances between a FI and a leaf ?
And the 32 port FI is more expensive than a 48 port leaf switch, so my question, do we really need FI unless we want to buy a bunch of UCS-B chassis?
ü§î
ahah according to the datasheet UCS Director talks directly with UCS-C https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/collateral/servers-unified-computing/ucs-director/datasheet-c78-730830.html?cachemode=refresh
Haha sorry for answering with more questions :P
Can you have UCS managers on the leafs?
Don‚Äôt you still need the UCS managers even though you have ucs director?
Does anyone know what is the point/advantage of connecting ucs-c to the fabric interconnect instead of directly to a leaf when you have ucs director managing everything anyways?
Here are some more details about the compatibility of ucs director but I guess the table summarize them well enough https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/unified_computing/ucs/ucs-director/compatibility-matrix/6-5/cisco-ucs-director-compatibility-matrix-65.html#reference_CA2B810FE58E4ADF8D3BA9FFA297C6AD

I think that goes for almost all the products UCS Director can manage. It covers a lot of the features, but for the really granular control you usually have to go to the Single Pane Of Glass‚Ñ¢ of the product.
From UCS director, you can manage most of the features of Dell/HP, but not all of them (depending on product and version).

Don‚Äôt forget to enjoy your holidays, Cedric ;)
Thanks Cedric!! ‚ò∫Ô∏è
In case anyone was wondering UCS Director can manage Dell and HP Servers as per the datasheet.
There are some requirements on the server side, but I think that‚Äôs not something we need to discuss in detail in the meeting.
that wasn‚Äôt my point, they told the to kind of ignore that or at least not focus on that

No idea, but there you have a question!
do you know which one it is ?
he said fortinet has a super cool feature that we dont have
You mean, what is their equivalent?
They can use PxGrid
probably ISE + PxGrid on Cisco side. What about Fortinet side ?
McAfee uses it as well
This last thing is PxGrid
for fortinet
do you know which feature he is talking about?

As a result of the work completed in the X8.9 release, Cisco Expressway is the preferred solution to meet with for the overwhelming majority of customer requirements. Cisco TelePresence Video Communication Server (VCS) delivers rich video collaboration throughout and beyond the enterprise network, and is ideal for organizations that do not have Cisco call control in their environment (that is, are not running Cisco Unified Communications Manager) but want to use Cisco TelePresence video conferencing applications.
great slide Alejandro!
Much better this
VCS
Expressway
Not always, they have different capabilities, so you may need one or the other, or both of them
Superset implies same but more
Sounds like it to me
Expressway = Basic
VCS = Advanced?
So you need either or?
^^ Exactly what I was about to say
Anyone any idea what¬¥s the difference between Expressway and VCS?

It could be nice indeed, do we have the budget from Cisco to do that ?
Yes !
from Prague?
Hi ASEs, I would like to know who is coming back the 2nd or 3rd of January to Cisco? I was thinking that it would be really nice if we could work remotely from Prague office this week of 2nd to 8th of Jan, as we only have OJE and the ARP is pushed away. Let me know if any of you are interested !
That‚Äôs a really good point ü§î
Nico just made a good point for those of you that are, like me, stressing out about the technical details. He said will you sell collab explaining how SIP works? Clearly not.
So for me at least that helped a lot to put it into perspective again. Think about what kind of impact the explanation needs to have and maybe guide the conversation away from the deep technical stuff if that starts happening.
Thanks Ale!

move voice over the WAN to reduce the cost (Amsterdam -> US through the WAN, and then you pay for a local call)
IP call, end-to-end
merging of voice, messaging and video (telepresence => dedicated room, like the one we used for ‚ÄúOK Go‚Äù)
ad-hoc meetings, easy scaling (cloud ‚òÅÔ∏è) and file-sharing

I‚Äôll learn this by heart and then just repeat this in one go
Great job !!!
From our facilitator :

The "phases" of the Cisco journey are 1- VOIP which is early/mid 1990's where customers utilized the WAN to move voice from one location to another which we called Toll Bypass 2- IP Telephony after the Selsius acquisition we then could replace the PBX with our CUCM solution and our IP Phones. We also could support voice mail as well. 3- Unified Communications came with the Jabber acquisition and the ability to add IM/Presence to our solution and have it deployed as a comprehensive solution. 4-Collaboration includes the Tandberg video solution, WebEx meeting solutions all integrated together. All of this was generally deployed on premise for our customers but Spark is the "next generation" collaboration that utilizes the cloud as a platform and enhances the IP/Presence, meeting, video, and voice along with specific technologies that make it easy to use. The good part is Cisco can provide a "hybrid" solution that connects your on premise solution with our cloud based Spark solution.
No big issues, but random stuff has started lagging and crashing for me that didn't happen before the update. 
VM yes, and have office is working now again
Have you updated your sw before you upgraded the OS?
i‚Äôve high sierra and outlook + VM are working
my VM still doesnt work
and also
had to completely reinstall office

why that?
The recent security bug can be fixed by setting a root password. Or is there something else?

Hey, good link (FAQ) regarding cisco ACI :

http://nexus9kaci.cisco.com/product-line/aci/aci-fabric-faq
Super helpful!
Thanks Lina!!!
Yeah, Prime is more a merge of APIC and the DNA dashboard. The way you access prime and push commands is on a much more manual basis than DNA where commands are pushed automatically on to your network via APIC-EM.
Thanks Cedric!
Not super good, but in essence Prime is a controller that has a web interface which configures your switches for you. But in the end it‚Äôs still individually configured switches.
DNA provides the complete separation between the brain/control plane - APIC-EM - and the data plane - which is the fabric comprised of all the switches. So all the automation and intelligence is separated from the switches.
Does anyone have a good understanding of the difference between Prime and DNA?
Hello I'm a poll bot. Here's what I can do when you use the following commands after mentioning me in a room. /poll followed by any question will create a poll in the room. /results will output the results of the poll. /clear will clear the poll from the room. NOTE: there can only be 1 poll in a room at a time.

‚Ä¢	The Limited Lifetime Warranty (LLW) that you have with your Catalyst 2960 covers hardware faults within five (5) years from the announcement of discontinuance. The last day to receive HW replacement of your Catalyst 2960 is thus set to April 30, 2022
Since I got this asked by Giuseppe
My Thoughts on ARP 2 - Some Questions I was asked

Know the difference between Prime and DNA if you propose DNA
Know how DNA Works if you propose it - overlay/underlay network - 4 Pillars: Security, Mobility, IoT, Cloud
Do 3/2 Tier Diagram top to bottom (Collapsed Core at the top - Access below, services on the core)
Take your time drawing to make it look nice
Advantages/Differences between older IOS and IOS-XE on 9ks
Migration Plan - What to do with the old switches?
Total Switching capacity of the switches
Are they blocking or Non-blocking
Regarding DNA Advantage and Essentials
Do not try to explain everything, you end up rushing too much
Move the conversation to topics you are more comfortable with, leave the more unknown topics to the end
Start from DNA Advantage, be able to explain the main differences between Advantage and Essentials
Do not mention the price at this point, try to divert the question for later meetings
Try to transform the marketing message in a couple of concrete tools that the customer can use
At the end try to remind the key points you touched

Hi everyone, here are the main comments from Giuseppe
For those who haven‚Äôt passed their ARPs yet, browse on eBay instead of ccw. Much cheaper
Otherwise I agree with Chris, especially for the BOM. As soon as you give it to the customer, you will loose his/her attention
- dont talk about too much features, otherwise the customer will be confused.
Thank you Chris!
Thanks :)

Hi everyone! Here are my comments from the ARP. My stand out piece of advice is be prepared to be thrown and be confident about your proposal. Call the presentation a ‚Äúproposal" :

2 Customers (they have different names)
They take notes, you should too.
Ensure that what you say you can explain.
Be prepared to bring up Cisco proprietary components.
Use the whiteboard (They will ask you if you don‚Äôt bring it up).
Use technical language.
Make sure technologies you bring up are also in your BOM.
BOM is final thing you hand over.

Guys, I think this is the most accurate slide describing DNA components. Some people asked on Friday about APIC-EM role here. Note that APIC-EM is version 2.x, which appears to be a bit different to what we‚Äôve seen (version up to 1.4). Also note that the use of APIC-EM is not mandatory.
Does anyone else get an Apache error when trying to create a new estimate?
Oh no...
same
Same same
me too
All my estimates are gone ! is it the same for you guys ?
I got access to CCW but all of my estimates are gone - anyone else have this problem?
Hahaha oh boy. Or Cologne vs Hoffenheim I guess. Do you have a stream for Arsenal though?
you Can watch Nice VS Dijon if you prefer üòÇ
Sylvain are any good teams playing too that I can watch instead? ;)
Have breakfast first guys
Arsenal VS Manchester City in 15 minutes, That‚Äôs an important thing to do and it does not require ccw :)
I guess we can enjoy the beautiful weather outside ? üòÇ
That‚Äôs alright, we don‚Äôt have anything important do do.

haha, no CCW today ‚Ä¶
Thank you!!!
Thanks for making it friendly :)
thanks
Thanks for reminding Rene
Just a friendly reminder to complete your ‚ÄúInstinctive Drives‚Äù questionnaire. The deadline is tomorrow and Nico said it¬¥s important that we all complete it in time.
The instructions are in an e-mail from ‚ÄúSarah Savoie‚Äù with the subject ‚ÄúReminder: GVS&CS Action Needed: Instinctive Drives Quest‚Äù

Anyone missing their MacBook charger?
We could just agree that we save one room for each manager (if Giuseppe -> room 1, Nico -> room 2 ...)
I think there is two rooms on the second floor
one can take Balboa and the other can take the 2nd floor room ?
You should probably start a google doc with what time your arp is and what day
What is your arp is at the same time as someone else‚Äôs though?
Sure!
Hey guys, can we agree that we let Balboa and the 2nd floor ‚Äúclass room‚Äù free, during the ARP ; so we can invite the managers in those rooms ?

Oh my bad
ASE only
haha, could always use some good memes
ask Frank otherwise, he can make great emails
good idea Antoine, I¬¥ll try that as well
e-mail would be best for the start I believe
maybe ask Irina Kormiletskaya ?
You fancy a mail format or more like a blog/website ?
Hi all,
as you probably know I¬¥m in the process of organizing an ASE Newsletter. I already got some great articles, but now it¬¥s time for the design/layout of the e-mail.
Anyone got some experience in that area and wants to help?
Yes please
I took 6 hours
I am done downloading the image (5,6 GB). I can share it through AirDrop if you want.
Hello Engineers,

For those using VIRL through dCloud, you can also use it directly on your own VM (apparently) ; so you don‚Äôt need to schedule a ‚ÄúVIRL demo‚Äù on dCloud.

Danke Antoine!
thank YOU ;)
thanks!
merci Antoine
you owe me 1 meatball/download
22MB instead of 22KG in books
Yeaaah

Does anyone have the ccnp switch book in pdf format?
thanks, you are my inspiration on this journey, Cedric
Much better smiling this time Antoine
you get*
lame
That‚Äôs a cool thing being on the first floor : you got the leftovers of the customer conferences
Good shit
No Marwan and I stole two sprites that where laying in the hallway
haha
Are you drinking beer?
Do you also know what the difference is between IOT ready and cloud ready? What the requirements are for both categories
cool, thanks !
Perfect üëç
Like 3850 and 6k
Yes, any devices marked as SD-A ready
anybody know if DNA runs on more than just the 9k series switches?
Sorry I just saw this. We took our laptops in, Nico said we are not supposed to use them but we all did some last minute prep while waiting for our turn. I am not sure on how they feel about using notes during the session, a few of us used them to double check some facts and they didn‚Äôt mention anything, but we are getting feedback during our 1:1s this week.
Thanks Cedric, no notes I believe?
Alright Kids, we just had our team meeting and we did our oral ‚Äúexams‚Äù. Nico did mention at the end that it is not strictly assessed so I would say don‚Äôt freak out about it.
We each drew a topic out of at hat and had to whiteboard about it for 10 minutes. We didn‚Äôt get any extra time to prepare apart from the time we had while the others were presenting. Guiseppe was there as well and they both asked questions at a pretty deep level.
The topics we had, which might change for you guys were:
1- 3 Tier Model
2-Stacking (focus on 3850)
3-mGiG
4-AVC
5-SDA
6-PoE
7-Switching Portfolio
8-IOS
Talking to Sen yesterday he said that he discussed giving the topics out one hour early with Nico, which is basically what happened with us, but we didn‚Äôt get the topics allocated of course.
Complete cloud

hahahaha
hahaha
for real?
My favourite framerate
Ah yes
Anybody know what that power of teams training is?
You‚Äôre welcome Antoine
thanks Lina
Afaik, dns-as also can't really do  encrypted traffic analysis. For this you need ETA
And regarding Antoine's statement: AVC can include DNS -AS as a feature. 
Dpi can't do traffic inspection with encrypted data 
Right! 
I figure DNS-AS could be used to learn about the application layer when the traffic is encrypted, since DPI doesn't work in that case (right?) 
I figure DNS-AS could be used to learn about the application layer when the traffic is encrypted, since DPI doesn't work in that case (right?) 
What do you think of CISCO AVC compared to DNS-AS ?
According to this documentation, DNS-AS could be used by Cisco AVC to identify applications.

and Google talk, haha
Wow the itunes logo used in that slide is ancient
I also have this, Alessandro, from the LAN-Module slides :
thanks
I sent it first, Max !
Probably same document that Antoine sent
https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/ios-xml/ios/qos_nbar/configuration/xe-16/qos-nbar-xe-16-book/nbar-dns-as.pdf
Yes 1 sek
does anyone have info about dns-as?
üçª
And also today üòÅ

Beers tomorrow after work 
Cool, thank you
yes it will stay master
‚Äúcommand : reload
To reload the stack member and to apply a configuration change, use the reload command in privileged EXEC mode.‚Äù

when you change the priority
I think they need to be rebooted
ye
stacking ?
If you turn one on first and it becomes master, it will stay master?
Switches don‚Äôt preempt for master selection, do they?
Cool, thank you!
Coolio thanks!
Coolio thanks!
here are my notes about stacking
üëå
I have the same table without cabling, but with 2 more standards
Yeah basically
I.e. it could do Class 1 and 2 powering even with Category 3 cabling
Ok üëçüèª
According to wikipedia all PoE require 5e or higher, but can use 3 and up if lower power is required
Some say PoE can run on cat 3 or higher
I‚Äôve seen different sources saying different minimum cable types.
Oh yes
De rien!
merci Lina !
Hm it kind of fucked up the format, I‚Äôll try again
And here is one on PoE
Thanks üí™
my notes about mGig Ethernet
Hey guys, this is just a really quick dot point overview of AVC from the presentation Ryan and I did last week. I thought it might be helpful if you wanted to include it in your notes.

thanks, Assia :)
So you should at least know what is it about :)
From what I remember, there is no pure SNMP question. But SNMP is tightly linked to MAC address table notifications or storm-control (for instance)
Regarding CCNP-SWITCH, there is a part in Digital-Learning to implement SNMPv3.
SNMP does not appear in the CCNP-SWITCH topics.
Assia Alessandro do you know if it will be tested during the exam ?

STOP ABUSING MONITORS
Maybe you made it work too much
Spoiler : swedish help desk failed
Started working again for some reason
Mine didn‚Äôt work for a couple of minutes once and i just left it unplugged for a bit
HOWWWW?!?! It worked yesterday!
Honestly though, if unplugging everything and plugging it all back again doesn‚Äôt work then either your monitor or cables are probably busted.
Wow Max you know so much. How do you do it?
Swedish help desk, on duty
Did you ask you monitor why he refuses to work?
Is your laptop on?
did you try violence ?
