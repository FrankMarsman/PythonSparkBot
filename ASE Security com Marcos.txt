ladies and gentlemen!!! happy Thursday!!!!!

We are on 23/27!!! Just 4 more to go =D

Thank you!!!
let‚Äôs see in real life
do you feel safer now ?
go AMP
this specific AMP we download from eStore has a script to remove McAfee from our PCs
hahaha no, that‚Äôs not the case‚Ä¶ it is just a script‚Ä¶ but COULD be haha
(just guessing, that‚Äôs not a quote from a datasheet)
McAfee is seen as a ransomeware by AMP. That‚Äôs why it gets uninstalled
didnt get the question ü§î
ransomeware*
McAfee is seen as a randsomeware, haha ?
i just love how dynamic this company is‚Ä¶ i think Antoine was the one who asked: why do WE use McAfee in our computers instead of AMP?

Well I just received an email from cisco asking to access eStore and search for AMP to install it‚Ä¶ it automatically removes McAfee
I hope you didnt get Dean‚Äôs feedback üòá
Safe flight to Brazil !
they‚Äôve updated the system apparently because AMS I was not seeing my name (but rather Dean‚Äôs name) in today‚Äôs survey
Hey folks, hello! This is Marcos directly from Portugal hehe

Just received a message saying that we are on 18/27 (66.6%) on today‚Äôs survey!

I know it‚Äôs late and you‚Äôre all happy because you don‚Äôt get to see me tomorrow morning but please take some minutes to provide feedback tomorrow morning!

Cheers!!
Rene thanks for sharing, that‚Äôs good stuff‚Ä¶ that is what we most often use to size the firewalls (remember they‚Äôre all the same on Software acpabilities, how it is really about how to size throughput, interfaces speed and number, etc)
i decline to comment hehe

We cant really determine that a copyright infringement happened. The workflow is really about responding to a notification of infringement that the customer may have gotten from an external source stating that they had observed infringing activity coming from the client site. Stealthwatch could then be used to track the IP and port in that notice back to an internal flow and user.
I saw a section in Stealthwatch that was about copyright infringement, sure it has nothing to do with selfies but what does it do ?
You forgot the selfies :p
all of you were awesome today!!! thank you for these amazing explanations/demos!!!
On our way!
let‚Äôs meet at the reception right‚Ä¶ now =D

Basically, MSE was the hardware and the software until version 8. After that, MSE is the appliance (physical or virtual) and CMX is the software, which starts from version 10

I feel like 66% isn‚Äôt that great if that estimation is true. 30B sounds more impressive by itself
Indeed, and imagine how the number boomed with Facebook
30/45 is pretty incredible then
This one estimates indexed in +- 45 b
üÜí Thanks chicos!
There you go
ok
Dark web
so 10bn indexed pages. And the rest?
Website = group of webpages
And that‚Äôs just WWW
